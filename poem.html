      <p>but you were falling to someone too.
    <p>my love is radiating you in summer of July,
    <p>but never thought you would lie.
      <p>it was Winter and your love has gone cold already,
    <p>how am i to dix it when you're aren't ready.
    <p>Spring and you began to bloom in ray,
      <p>and now i guess, you're the on that got away.

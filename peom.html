    i fell for you just like autumn leaves do,
but you were falling to someone too.
my love is radiating you in summer of July,
but never thought you would lie.
it was Winter and your love has gone cold already,
how am i to fix it when you're aren't ready.
Spring and you began to bloom in ray,
and now i guess,you're the one that got away.

    <p><em>but you were falling to someone</em> too.</em>

<p>but never thought you would lie.
<p>it was Winter and your love has gone cold already,
<p>how am i to dix it when you're aren't ready.
  <p><strong>Spring and you began to bloom in ray,</strong>
<p><strong>and now i guess, you're the on that got away.</strong>
